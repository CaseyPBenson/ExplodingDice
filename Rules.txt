# 1.0 Introduction
Exploding Dice is a stupid filler game about rolling dice.

## 1.1 Objective
The player who explodes all their dice first wins.

# 2.0 Components
* 49 dice
  * 7 of each, in 7 colors:
    * d4
    * d6
    * d8
    * d10
    * d12
    * d20
    * d30

# 3.0 Playing the Game
Give each player their 7 dice. Starting with the d4, each player rolls their dice as fast as they can. Once they've rolled the highest number on that dice, they move up to the next-highest die.
Once a player 'explodes' the d30, they win.
